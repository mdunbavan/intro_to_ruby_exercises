# 1. Write a method which receives the name of a color as a string
# and then returns a String "You chose #{color}". If the color is not
# one of ['red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'green'] raise an exception with
# the message "Not a valid color".

# 2. Call this method, with the color "red" and print out the result

# 3. Call this method, with the color "octarine"

# 4. Rescue the exception that is raised in 3, and print out the error
# message (i.e. you shouldn't see the stack trace).
