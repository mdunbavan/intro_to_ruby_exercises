# 1. Write a method that takes an age (as a number), and returns
#    the year of birth. Display the output of calling the method with
#    your age.


# 2. Write a method that takes any number of numeric arguments, and
#    then prints out the month name for each of those numbers on a
#    single line. i.e. for the arguments 1, 4, 5 the print out should
#    be "January April May". Remember variable scope and the fact
#    array indexes start at 0

months = ["January", "February", "March", "April",
          "May", "June", "July", "August", "September",
          "October", "November", "December"]
