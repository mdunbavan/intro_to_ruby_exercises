# 1. In the /lib directory, define an Animal class with a 
# number_of_legs attribute. Create 3 subclasses of Animal for Dog, Cat
# and Mouse, each with a make_noise method that returns a String with
# the noise appropriate for the animal.

# Once you've defined the classes, require them in this file, create
# an Array with 3 animals in it and loop over it printing out to the
# console the noises that those animals make.
